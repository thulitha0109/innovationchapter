Main Description: This project involved a complete redesign of a Shopify store with extensive customizations. The client's primary requirement was to develop a user-friendly "Find Parts" filter with a sleek UI. However, integrating this new UI with the existing product filter app caused functionality issues. To resolve this, we built a custom app specifically tailored for managing their filter system. Additionally, we provided custom graphics through our design design team and implemented several unique features, including a custom search option and a bespoke footer.
