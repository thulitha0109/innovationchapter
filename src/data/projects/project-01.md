Amore Clothing is a Sri Lankan fashion brand that I had the opportunity to work with. They specialize in unique, luxurious women’s fashion, bringing stylish and high-quality clothing to Sri Lankan customers. While features like the e-gift option and loyalty platform were key client requirements, my primary goal was to create a unique, visually appealing, and high-end website that truly reflected the brand’s identity. These additional features played an important role, but my main focus was on delivering a well-designed and seamless user experience.
